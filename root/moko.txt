Simple and really small (~1.2 KiB without ELF overhead) text editor
created specifically for this operating system.

to do:

  ctrl + backspace - delete previous word,
  ctrl + delete - delete next word,
  ctrl + s - save file

in the future (at the moment I don't suffer from their absence):

  text highlight,
  ctrl + a, ctrl + c, ctrl + v, ctrl + x

implemented:

  - current line highlighted,
  - sliders only indicate which part of document is visible, there is no
    possibility of interfering with them,

  standard keys:
    enter :D,
    backspace/delete,
    home/end,
    arrows,
    page up/down

  ctrl + o - read file,
  ctrl + arrow left - move cursor to beginning of previous word,
  ctrl + arrow right - move cursor to end of next word,
  ctrl + arrow up - move cursor at beginning of previous line,
  ctrl + arrow down - move cursor at end of next line
